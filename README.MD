### Weighted Options
Most of today's 2D fighters still rely on some form of Rock, Paper, Scissors (Attack, Block, Grab).  The option a player chooses is based on weighted criteria.  This game seeks to bring that idea to its simplest form.  Your choices will have different point values (1-6 / standard dice roll), but your opponent will know them, too.  Play ends when a player reaches 15 points.  Let the mind games begin.
